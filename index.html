				<h2>PHAN NHAT HAN</h2>
				<p>My name is Han, and I’ve been designing websites and online graphics. Started when I was eighteen, and I quickly found passion for the work, and spent almost my entire free time working on projects for friends, for school, or for my own pleasure. You can check my principal works with description on my online portfolio at [link to your portfolio]. Now I am  looking for a job in a webdesign studio, or in a well-established IT company, in order to further develop my designing skills and work on major projects. I work mostly with Adobe, but I am eager to learn working with other software programs. In my free time, when I am not designing anything, I enjoy hiking and spending time away from my laptop.</p>
